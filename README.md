IntroAPI
========

This is a repo for our class's Intro to APIs series

Did 3 things to get python going:

1) install python 2.7 here https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/

2) setup "python" as a variable in path (for windows only) by googling or typing into cmd path = C:\python27

3) install requests by running python setup.py install after downloading https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests (I did it as a zip because I need to learn more about github)
